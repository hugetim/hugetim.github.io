    "text": "New data on immigration arrests was released recently. I learned about it from an Axios article yesterday highlighting the June increase in non-criminal arrests (non-criminal because “being in the U.S. illegally is a civil, not criminal, violation”). The article led with the following chart:\nI was curious whether there had been a proportionate increase in ICE arrests near me in Wisconsin, as opposed to the increase being concentrated in places like California. So I downloaded the data from the Deportation Data Project.1\nImport data into Stata\nclear all\nquietly import excel \"C:\\Users\\tjhuegerich\\Downloads\\2025-ICLI-00019_2024-ICFO-39357_ERO Admin Arrests_raw.xlsx\", sheet(\"Admin Arrests\") cellrange(A7:W265233) firstrow\nThe raw data is detailed enough to identify individual arrests by date and location.2 But here I just need date, state, and “criminal status.”\nCollapse to counts by state and criminal classification\ngen date = dofc(ApprehensionDate)\nquietly drop if date &gt; mdy(6,26,2025) // limited 6/27 data\nencode ApprehensionCriminality, gen(cs_id)\nassert !missing(BirthYear)\ncollapse (count) n=BirthYear, by(date ApprehensionState cs_id)\nFirst I confirmed that I could replicate the Axios chart.\nReplicate Axios chart\nframe copy default NATIONAL\nframe NATIONAL {\n    collapse (sum) n, by(date cs_id)\n    quietly {\n        xtset cs_id date\n        tsfill, full\n        replace n = 0 if missing(n)\n        tssmooth ma n_7trailing_ = n, window(6 1 0)\n        drop n\n        reshape wide n_7trailing_ , i(date) j(cs_id)\n    }\n    format date %tdMonYY\n    label var n_7trailing_1 \"At least one conviction\"\n    label var n_7trailing_2 \"At least one charge (no conviction)\"\n    label var n_7trailing_3 \"No criminal charges or convictions\"\n    tsline n_7trailing_1 n_7trailing_2 n_7trailing_3 if date &gt;= mdy(1,7,2025), ///\n        lcolor(\"#FE9116\" \"#FEC170\" \"#102BB6\") xtitle(\"\") xlabel(#7) legend(position(12)) ///\n        title(\"ICE arrests by reported criminal status\") ///\n        subtitle(\"Daily, Seven-day trailing average\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Arrests were counted even if they did not lead to detainment; Multiple arrests of the same individual were counted separately; original chart by Kavya Beheraj/Axios.\nThen I zoomed out to allow a comparison between the Biden and Trump administrations, also using a different style of chart to more easily see total immigration arrests."

Ideally someone would put up some interactive charts so that answering a question like this would be easier. If I become aware of any, I’ll put the link(s) here."

He is classified in the data as a “Convicted Criminal” despite, I’m told, merely having the same name as a fugitive from a different country, one thousands of miles away from his own. So maybe take these ICE classifications with a grain of salt.↩︎"
