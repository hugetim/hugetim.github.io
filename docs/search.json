    "text": "New data on immigration arrests was released recently. I learned about it from an Axios article yesterday highlighting the June increase in non-criminal arrests (non-criminal because “being in the U.S. illegally is a civil, not criminal, violation”). The article led with the following chart:\nI was curious whether there had been a proportionate increase in ICE arrests near me in Wisconsin, as opposed to the increase being concentrated in places like California. So I downloaded the data from the Deportation Data Project.1\nImport data into Stata\nclear all\nquietly import excel \"C:\\Users\\tjhuegerich\\Downloads\\2025-ICLI-00019_2024-ICFO-39357_ERO Admin Arrests_raw.xlsx\", sheet(\"Admin Arrests\") cellrange(A7:W265233) firstrow\nThe raw data is detailed enough to identify individual arrests by date and location.2 But here I just need date, state, and “criminal status.”\nCollapse to counts by state and criminal classification\ngen date = dofc(ApprehensionDate)\nquietly drop if date &gt; mdy(6,26,2025) // limited 6/27 data\nencode ApprehensionCriminality, gen(cs_id)\nassert !missing(BirthYear)\ncollapse (count) n=BirthYear, by(date ApprehensionState cs_id)\nFirst I confirmed that I could replicate the Axios chart.\nReplicate Axios chart\nframe copy default NATIONAL\nframe NATIONAL {\n    collapse (sum) n, by(date cs_id)\n    quietly {\n        xtset cs_id date\n        tsfill, full\n        replace n = 0 if missing(n)\n        tssmooth ma n_7trailing_ = n, window(6 1 0)\n        reshape wide n_7trailing_ n, i(date) j(cs_id)\n    }\n    format date %tdMonYY\n    label var n_7trailing_1 \"At least one conviction\"\n    label var n_7trailing_2 \"At least one charge (no conviction)\"\n    label var n_7trailing_3 \"No criminal charges or convictions\"\n    tsline n_7trailing_1 n_7trailing_2 n_7trailing_3 if date &gt;= mdy(1,7,2025), ///\n        lcolor(\"#FE9116\" \"#FEC170\" \"#102BB6\") xtitle(\"\") xlabel(#7) legend(position(12)) ///\n        title(\"ICE arrests by reported criminal status\") ///\n        subtitle(\"Daily, Seven-day trailing average\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Arrests were counted even if they did not lead to detainment; Multiple arrests of the same individual were counted separately; original chart by Kavya Beheraj/Axios.\nThen I zoomed out to allow a comparison between the Biden and Trump administrations, also using a different style of chart to more easily see total immigration arrests."

    "text": "Wisconsin\nFinally, I wanted a comparable chart for Wisconsin. Because daily Wisconsin arrests are generally in the single digits, making even a moving average of daily arrests quite choppy, I instead plotted weekly arrests.\nFor purposes of cross-state comparison, I made the y-axis match the scale of the California chart after adjusting for estimated 2022 unauthorized immigrant populations (and the use of a weekly measure rather than daily).3\n\n\nCreate Wisconsin chart\nframe copy default WISCONSIN\nframe WISCONSIN {\n    quietly {\n        keep if ApprehensionState == \"WISCONSIN\"\n        local end_dow = 4 // b/c data ends on 2025-6-26, a Thurs.\n        gen week_date = `end_dow' + (date - dow(date)) if dow(date) &lt;= `end_dow' \n        replace week_date = `end_dow' + (date + 7 - dow(date)) if dow(date) &gt; `end_dow'\n        collapse (sum) n, by(cs_id week_date)\n        xtset cs_id week_date\n        tsfill, full\n        assert missing(n) if dow(week_date) != `end_dow'\n        keep if dow(week_date) == `end_dow'\n        replace n = 0 if missing(n)\n        reshape wide n, i(week_date) j(cs_id)\n        gen cumul2 = n1 + n2\n        gen cumul3 = cumul2 + n3\n        \n        expand 2, gen(week_start) // to enable 'stairstep' chart, visually representing weekly aggregation\n        replace week_date = week_date - 6 if week_start\n        sort week_date\n    }\n    label var n1 \"At least one conviction\"\n    label var cumul2 \"At least one charge (no conviction)\"\n    label var cumul3 \"No criminal charges or convictions\"\n    format week_date %tdMonCCYY\n    twoway (area cumul3 cumul2 n1 week_date if week_date &gt;= mdy(9,21,2023), ///\n            color(\"#102BB6\" \"#FEC170\" \"#FE9116\") fintensity(75 75 75) lwidth(none none none)), ///\n        xtitle(\"\") legend(ring(0) bplacement(11)) xlabel(#10) ///\n        yscale(range(46.7))  ///\n        title(\"Wisconsin ICE arrests by reported criminal status\") ///\n        subtitle(\"Weekly\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Wisconsin arrests had apparently been comparable to pre-2025 rates until the past couple months. And the recent increase is not as dramatic as that experienced by California or the U.S. as a whole. On the other hand, recent arrest rates relative to unauthorized population appear comparable to those in California.\nThere is a lot more that could be done with this data. Ideally someone would put up some interactive charts so that answering a question like this would be easier. If I become aware of any, I’ll put the link(s) here."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThe “Late June 2025” Arrests data, specifically.↩︎\nFor instance, I was able to find the record for an acquaintance arrested in the Madison area. He is classified in the data as a “Convicted Criminal” despite, I’m told, merely having the same name as a fugitive from a different country, one thousands of miles away from his own. So maybe take these ICE classifications with a grain of salt.↩︎\nPew Research estimates California’s 2022 unauthorized immigrant population as 1.8 million and Wisconsin’s as 80 thousand. So I set the Wisconsin y-axis maximum to: \\(150 \\times \\frac{80}{1800} \\times 7 \\approx 46.7\\).↩︎"
